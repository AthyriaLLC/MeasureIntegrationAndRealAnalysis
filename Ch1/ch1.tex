% Problem 1
\begin{problem}{1}
Suppose $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \R$ is a bounded function such that

\[L(f, P, [a,b]) = U(f,P,[a,b])\]

for some partion $P$ of $[a,b]$. Prove that $f$ is a constant function on $[a,b]$.

\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $f$ is not a constant function on $[a,b]$. That is, for any partition $P$ of $[a,b]$ we have
\[a=x_0<x_1<x_2<\ldots<x_n=b\]

\[L(f,P,[a,b]) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-x_{j-1})\inf_{[x_{j-1},x_{j}]}f\]
and
\[U(f,P,[a,b]) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-x_{j-1})\sup_{[x_{j-1},x_{j}]}f\]
which implies that there must be some $k\in\Z, 0\leq k<n$ for which $\inf_{[x_{k-1},x{k}]}f\ne\sup_{[x_{k-1},x_{k}]}f$. But that would leave
\[L(f, P, [a,b]) \ne U(f,P,[a,b])\]
contradicting the premise.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{2}
	Suppose $a\leq s<t\leq b$. Define $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \R$ by

	\[f(x)=\begin{cases}
		1 &\text{if} ~~ s<x<t,\\
		0 &\text{otherwise.}
	\end{cases}\]
Prove that $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a,b]$ and that $\int_a^bf = t - s.$
\end{problem}
